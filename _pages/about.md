I am a graduate student in the [Computer Vision Group](http://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison advised by [Prof. Mohit Gupta](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mohitg/). My current work is in 3D imaging with time of flight cameras. I am currently working on the design and implementation of new coding functions for time of flight imaging that reliably perform in low SNR scenarios. 

In general, I am interested in both the theory of imaging systems and in the co-design of software and hardware required to implement such systems. My work and graduate studies have primarily focused on the fields of computational imaging/photography/optics, image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

I did my undergraduate studies at UW-Madison where I graduated from the [AMEP](https://www.math.wisc.edu/amep) and Computer Sciences programs. During my undergraduate I worked with [Prof. Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/) on the [statistical analysis of brain images](http://felipegb94.github.io/RapidPT/), and with [Prof. Dan Negrut](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~negrut/) on [high performance computing applied to fluid simulations](https://github.com/uwsbel/CharmSPH).
