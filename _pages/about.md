I am a first year graduate student in the [Computer Vision Group](http://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison advised by [Prof. Mohit Gupta](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mohitg/). My research interests are in computational imaging, optimization, machine learning and physics-based models.

I did my undergraduate studies at UW-Madison where I graduated from the [AMEP](https://www.math.wisc.edu/amep) and Computer Sciences programs. During my undergraduate I worked with [Prof. Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/) on the [statistical analysis of brain images](http://felipegb94.github.io/RapidPT/), and with [Prof. Dan Negrut](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~negrut/) on [high performance computing applied to fluid simulations](https://github.com/uwsbel/CharmSPH).
