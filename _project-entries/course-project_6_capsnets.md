title: Image Recognition and Retrieval with Capsule Networks
description: For the Machine Learning (CS760) course my teammates and I studied Capsule Networks and evaluated their performance in the content-based image retrieval task. We modified two different Capsule Net impementations in Tensorflow and applied them to the image retrieval task on the Google Landmark dataset.
