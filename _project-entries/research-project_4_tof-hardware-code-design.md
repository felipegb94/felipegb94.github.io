title: Coding Function Design for Time of Flight Imaging
description: Recent work on the <a href="http://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/project/tofcoding/" target="_blank">coding theory of ToF</a> introduced a set of coding functions that can achieved higher depth resolution than the commonly used sinusoid coding. In practice, these new functions require the light source to be able to emit extremely short high-powered pulses. Such pulses require extremely high bandwidth and peak power light source. In this project we designed a new set of coding functions with equivalent performance as the ones proposed in the above work, but that adhere to the specified peak power and bandwidth constraints of the system.
