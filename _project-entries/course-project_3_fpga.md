title: FPGA control of Quadcopter motors
description: Throughout the Digital System Design and Synthesis course (ECE551) we developed all the building blocks to control the motors on a quadcopter. We developed modules and testbenches for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Universal Async Receiver Transmitted (UART), Electronic Speed Control (ESC), Analog to Digital Conversion, inertial sensor interfaces, etc.  The final project involved putting everything together and testing it our code thoroughly. Finally, once we were sure everything was working we were able to test it and control an actual Quadcopter. The modules and testbenches were all coded in Verilog.
