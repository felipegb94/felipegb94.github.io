title: Lone Ranger - A flexible time-of-flight camera for research
description: The Lone Ranger is a modular continuous-wave time-of-flight camera for 3D sensing built from off the shelf parts. The main components are an arbitrary function generator, RF modulated laser, beam splitter, galvo mirrors, focusing lens, an APD, a frequency mixer, RF amplifiers, a low pass filter, and a data acquisition card. The triggers, controls, and data acquisition are fully automated with LabVIEW.
