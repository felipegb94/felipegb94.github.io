title: Depth Inference from Time of Flight data with Neural Networks
description: For the Deep Neural Networks course, my teammates explored to the idea of training a neural network to learn to predict depth from continuous-wave time of flight data. Depth inference from time of flight measurements can be done with an analytical formula. This formula, however, makes some simplifying assumptions on the data and does not use the fact that neighbor pixels should have similar depth. We developed a training dataset of simulated time of flight data for various shapes and trained a fully convolutional network to perform depth inference.
