title: Mesh to Point Cloud Conversion Tool
description: We evaluated three different approaches to generate a dense point cloud from a 3D mesh file. In particle-based fluid-solid interaction simulations there can be three types of SPH markers; fluid, boundary, or solid. In such simulations it is desirable to take have a dense point cloud representation of a 3D mesh for the solid SPH markers. We find that a ray-crossing approach to detect if a particle is inside the mesh or not is a simple and effective way to generate the point clouds.
