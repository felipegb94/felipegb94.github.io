                <h3>Current Positions</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I currently hold two part-time research assistant positions, one of which is partly supported by the <a href="http://shodor.org/petascale/participation/internships/" target="_blank">Blue Waters Student Internship Program (BWSIP)</a>.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            I work at the <a href="http://sbel.wisc.edu" target="_blank">Simulation-Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) </a> under <a href="http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~negrut/" target="_blank">Professor Dan Negrut</a> and <a href="http://armanpazouki.github.io/" target="_blank"> Dr. Arman Pazouki</a>. At SBEL I assist in the investigation of parallel computing techniques for GPU, shared and distributed memory architectures and their application to fluid-solid interaction problems. I regularly report my work at SBEL to the BWSIP. As part of the program I will be submitting a paper about my work and experience throughout BWSIP to the Journal of Computational Science Education.

                            I also work in <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/" target="_blank">Professor Vikas Singh Group</a>, where I collaborate with Prof. Singh and Vamsi Ithapu on topics related to statistical analysis of brain imaging datasets. My undergraduate thesis will be based on all the work I did in Prof. Singh's group.
