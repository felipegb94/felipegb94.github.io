This is the repository for my personal website. To access the website go to [felipegb94.github.io](http://felipegb94.github.io). Feel free to use it as the starting point for your website.

### Editing the site locally

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This will make the site available on the localhost.  Once you are done editing the site you can run `bundle exec jekyll build` and then `./sync.sh` to sync the static site that was generated to the public html where it is hosted.  

### Todo

* Improve project layout. Some of the titles and project divs lie to close to each other.
* Add my name to the top left of the navigation bar.
* Take a look at Jon Barron and Ayush Bhandari project pages.

### Comments

In order to keep the repository as light-weight as possible I am linking bootstrap and jquery to the website through the corresponding cdns. Therefore make sure you have a good internet connection when trying to access it.

### Acknowledgements

This personal website was created using a combination of different bootstrap templates obtained from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
