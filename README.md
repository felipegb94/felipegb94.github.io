This is the repository for my personal website. To access the website go to [felipegb94.github.io](http://felipegb94.github.io). Feel free to use it as the starting point for your website.

### Editing the site locally

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This will make the site available on the localhost.  Once you are done editing the site you can run `bundle exec jekyll build` and then `./sync.sh` to sync the static site that was generated to the public html where it is hosted.  

### Acknowledgements
