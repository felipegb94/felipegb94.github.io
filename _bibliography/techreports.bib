	abstract = {The marked increase of space debris over the past several decades poses a threat to the future of space travel. If many current predictions hold true, space travel will become infeasible within our lifetimes due to elevated debris density. Without intervention, the density of Earth's orbital space could become an unstable, unnavigable debris field. In order to evaluate solutions that address this problem, the current state and future behavior of space debris concentrations must be understood. We have created a working model for both of these issues. Our model is based on well-researched data and is able to be manipulated to show effects of natural perturbations and human intervention.

	We began with an unperturbed, deterministic model of orbital decay. This illustrates the constant orbital decay of debris due to atmospheric drag. To build towards reality, we added events based on Continuous Time Markov Chains. These events are able to model a tremendous variety of processes that may take place in space. Within the scope of the contest, we were able to account for spacecraft launches and launch-related debris, debris fragments colliding with others, catastrophic collisions of fragments with spacecraft, and the removal of space debris.

	While our model could be expanded to account for the intricacies of space debris interactions, it is able to match other, thoroughly researched models for a scenario in which we do nothing to reduce the amount of debris. To explore the potential benefits of debris removal systems, we include that process in our simulation. We were able to quantify the minimum reduction rates necessary to make a difference, as well as the greatest effects that could be seen from the most promising strategy currently available. Our results show that debris reduction operations for as little as five years are able to have profound effects for a century of space travel. Estimated cost savings from reducing risk of catastrophic collisions range from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. These results indicate that current strategies are commercially attractive and support the development of space-based laser initiatives in order to solve the problem of space junk.}
