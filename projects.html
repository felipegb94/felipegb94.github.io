The CPU implementation relies on the linear algebra library, Armadillo. The GPU implementation currently relies on ArrayFire for the computation part but uses Armadillo for some I/O.

The main purpose of this code is to act as a prototyping environment of boundary conditions, integration schemes and techniques to improve the simulation stability. The three basic features of the program are: fast neighbor search, leap-frog time integration, and the use of static SPH markers as wall boundaries. The ultimate goal is that as more and more SPH features are prototyped in this environment the code will evolve into a mature SPH code.

                    <div class="col-sm-12 project-description">
                        <strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/uwsbel/metrics-database" target="_blank">Metrics Database</a>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Description: </strong>This project was developed to record output metrics (mostly performance) of the tests that are run on the open source multi-physics engine, <a href="https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono" target="_blank">Chrono</a>, and be able to query these metrics and display on a web application. In order to meet this goal I developed five pieces of code that together fully automated the process of tracking these metrics, and a sixth component that will hopefully be implemented in the future. 
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <strong><a href="https://github.com/felipegb94/BaseTest" target="_blank">BaseTest:</a> </strong>First I developed a BaseTest class from which all tests that wish to report metrics are derived from. This allowed the test developers to easily report the metrics by just calling a simple function called addMetric(...). The class would then output the metrics in a JSON format. 
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Parser: </strong>The second part of the program was the parser. Whenever a push is made to Chrono there is an automated build system (buildbot based) that runs a bunch of tests, some of which are derived from BaseTest. After all the tests are ran a lot of JSON files have been generated, and builbot calls a parsing script which parses each file and adds them to a PostgreSQL database through an API call.
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Metrics Database API: </strong>Any kind of request made to the relational database had to be done through a Flask-based API. This allowed easily handle things like reading and writing to the database, and authentication.
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Database: </strong>A PostgreSQL database was used. The database was created and updated using a python package called SQLAlchemy. 
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Frontend: </strong>The frontend allows Chrono developers to visualize the time evolution of the metrics. This is interesting for performance metrics since you can see how certain parts of Chrono improve (or get worse) in performance as modifications are made. But it can also be used to monitor that the accuracy of certain benchmark simulations stays over a threshold.
                                </li> 
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Notification System (Not implemented): </strong> A notification system will hopefully be implemented in the future. The aim of this feature is to notify Chrono users of significant performance decrease after a push is made.

                            <strong>Description: </strong>PointCloudWebUtils are two WebGL/Three.js powered tools that I made to make the SPH model development easier for myself. 
                        </br></br>
                            The first one is a simple point cloud rendering tool that receives a csv file as an input and displays a color-coded point cloud where the colors represent the SPH marker type (fluid, boundary or solid). I  could also use Paraview or other visualizing tool but having to specify a bunch of options only to visualize the first time step to see if the initialization was done correctly is a couple minutes of work against a couple seconds in the web app.
                        </br></br>
                            The second one is the implementation of the ray crossing approach described in the Evaluation of Mesh To Point Cloud Alternatives report. I generates a point cloud from an input .obj file or from one of the premade meshes in three.js (cube, cylinder, torus, etc.). The figure on the right is the input mesh and the resulting point cloud of a humvee model.

                            <strong>Description: </strong>Together with two other members of SBEL we explored three alternatives to generate a point cloud from a mesh file (stl, obj, etc). The three approaches are briefly described <a href="Papers/TR-MeshToPointCloudTool/TR-2015-10.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The technical report is still incomplete and still needs some figures, corrections and updates.
                        </br></br>
                            <strong>Why? </strong>In FSI simulations that are based on a lagrangian representation of both the solid and the fluid (SPH) there is a need to have a point cloud representation of the solid. The point cloud that represents the solid are Boundary Condition Enforcing (BCE) markers which are essential to calculate the coupling forces [add citation]. For simple geometries creating a point cloud is relatively simple but for complex geometries it is not. Using modern CAD tools creating any kind of 3D geometry has become a trivial task, but all of these tools only export meshes and do not give the option to export a point cloud representation of the mesh. Therefore a mesh to point cloud converter tool is essential to develop a wide variety of FSI models.

                            <strong>Description: </strong>This is an example program that can easily switch between its OpenMP and CUDA implementations by changing some flags in the CMakeLists.txt file. The program calculates pi. Using a combination of macros and one of CUDA's newest features, unified memory, almost 100% of the code could be reused. Using macros a function can act as a regular function whose for loop is embedded in a OpenMP clause, or a CUDA kernel. If the program is compiled with CUDA and unified memory is available then the function/kernel call can be made by giving it a pointer to the memory allocated with cudaMallocManaged and the OpenMP and CUDA backend will be able to write to this memory without any problem. This can be seen in pi-kernel-unified.cu. This code was also used to see the performance of Multi-threading vs. GPU in one of the developer nodes of the cluster.
