        <p>Permutation testing is a non-parametric method for obtaining the max null distribution used to compute corrected p-values to provide strong control of false positives. In neuroimaging, however, the computational burden of running such algorithm can be probihitively slow. We find that by viewing the permutation testing procedure as the construction of a very large permutation testing matrix T one can exploit structural properties derived from the data and the test statistics to reduce the overall runtime under certain conditions. In particular, we see that T has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual. This makes T a good candidate for low-rank matrix completion methods, where only a relatively small number of entries of T ( 0.35% of all entries) have to be computed to obtain good estimate of it. Based on this observation we developed an algorithmic framework, we called RapidPT, that is able to efficiently recover the max null distribution commonly obtained through regular permutation testing. We present an extensive experimental validation on 4 varying sized datasets against two baselines: Statistical NonParametric Mapping (SnPM13) and a regular permutation testing implementation (referred to as NaivePT). We find that RapidPT achieves its best runtime performance on medium sized datasets (50 ≤ n ≤ 200), outperforming both baselines on all datasets (SnPM13: 1.5x - 38x, NaivePT: 20x-1000x). For larger datasets (n ≥ 200) RapidPT is able to outperform NaivePT (6x - 200x) on all datasets, and provide substantial speedups over SnPM13 when performing more than 10000 permutations (2x - 15x). The MATLAB implementation is freely available as a stand alone toolbox called RapidPT or as a plugin in SnPM13, and is able to leverage multi-core architectures when available.</p>

        <p>We present a distributed memory framework for large-scale fluid-solid interaction simulations called Chrono::HPC. In this simulation environment the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is employed to simulate the dynamics of fluid interacting with 3D rigid bodies. The implementation relies on Charm++, an asynchronous message passing parallel programming framework able to run in a distributed memory/cluster setup. Charm++ is an objectbased programming paradigm whose work and data units are organized as C++ objects called chares. We employ a hybrid decomposition strategy that targets the parallelization of both the physical domain and force computation, where the physical domain is divided into cells referred to herein as cell chare objects. Force computations are performed using compute chare objects that are assigned to pairs of interacting cells as well as the cell itself. The sets of cell and compute chares are organized into their respective chare arrays. A cell chare array is a dense 3D array whose indices (x, y, z) have a one-to-one mapping to the spatial decomposition of the problem. Compute chares are organized into a sparse 6D chare array. Each component of this array, indexed as (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2), handles the interaction of cell pairs with indices (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2). This hybrid decomposition scheme allows the implementation to follow three of the core components of the Charm++ parallel programming paradigm: object-oriented (cell and compute chares), over-decomposition, and asynchronous message-driven execution. The overdecomposition component of Chrono::HPC comes into play when minimizing the compute idle time. The number of cell and compute chares is selected to be greater than the number of available computational cores. This allows the Charm++ Runtime System (RTS) to assign multiple chares to each core. Charm++ RTS chooses to alternate between chares when they are waiting for data, which hides memory latency by overlapping computation and distributed memory access. This over-decomposition decision is motivated by Charm++’s asynchronous message-driven nature. An additional chare array handles the rigid body dynamics by (a) processing the reduction of distributed fluid forces on each body, and (b) advancing its state in time through numerical integration. The Chrono::HPC framework is demonstrated via a simulation of a dam-break problem containing buoyant rigid bodies and scaled to systems with tens of millions of degrees of freedom. The results obtained indicate linear strong scaling of the simulation engine, which demonstrates if ability to leverage supercomputers to simulate FSI problems with dimensions larger than those tested herein.</p>

        <p>The marked increase of space debris over the past several decades poses a threat to the future of space travel. If many current predictions hold true, space travel will become infeasible within our lifetimes due to elevated debris density. Without intervention, the density of Earth’s orbital space could become an unstable, unnavigable debris field. In order to evaluate solutions that address this problem, the current state and future behavior of space debris concentrations must be understood. We have created a working model for both of these issues. Our model is based on well-researched data and is able to be manipulated to show effects of natural perturbations and human intervention.

	We began with an unperturbed, deterministic model of orbital decay. This illustrates the constant orbital decay of debris due to atmospheric drag. To build towards reality, we added events based on Continuous Time Markov Chains. These events are able to model a tremendous variety of processes that may take place in space. Within the scope of the contest, we were able to account for spacecraft launches and launch-related debris, debris fragments colliding with others, catastrophic collisions of fragments with spacecraft, and the removal of space debris.

	While our model could be expanded to account for the intricacies of space debris interactions, it is able to match other, thoroughly researched models for a scenario in which we do nothing to reduce the amount of debris. To explore the potential benefits of debris removal systems, we include that process in our simulation. We were able to quantify the minimum reduction rates necessary to make a difference, as well as the greatest effects that could be seen from the most promising strategy currently available. Our results show that debris reduction operations for as little as five years are able to have profound effects for a century of space travel. Estimated cost savings from reducing risk of catastrophic collisions range from tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. These results indicate that current strategies are commercially attractive and support the development of space-based laser initiatives in order to solve the problem of space junk.</p>
